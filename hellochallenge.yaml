description: 'Welcome to ctfd.io! Our goal is to welcome students of all backgrounds.

For those that may not know, the goal for each problem is find a flag, usually (but not always) in the text form of flag{thisisaflag}. Problems that do not follow this format will be specifically identified. Capitals almost always matter, but sometimes will not and will be notated as such. Also remember, Computer Scientists always start counting from 0.

Thank you for joining us and please use this flag to get off to a good start:

flag{HelloWorld!}

Have fun!'

value: 10

flags:
    - flag{HelloWorld!}
